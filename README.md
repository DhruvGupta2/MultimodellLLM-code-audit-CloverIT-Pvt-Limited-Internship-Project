#  LLM Code Audit - Comprehensive Documentation
---
### 📌 Internship Project
This project was part of my **Summer Internship at Clover IT Services Pvt Ltd**.  
I was responsible for end-to-end design and development, including frontend (React + Vite), backend (Firebase + Firestore), and AI integrations (ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, LLaMA, Mistral).

**LLM Code Audit** is an intelligent, developer-focused tool designed to **generate, evaluate, and compare code** outputs from multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), including **ChatGPT**, **Gemini**, **DeepSeek**, **LLaMA**, and **Mistral**.

Whether you're prototyping, benchmarking, or auditing AI-generated code, this platform helps you make **data-driven decisions** by providing detailed metrics around code complexity, maintainability, and readability. 

With real-time analysis, visual dashboards, and history tracking, LLM Code Audit enables a transparent and measurable way to choose the best code output for your needs — all in a clean, user-friendly interface.

##  Introduction

![Model selection](./screenshots/modelselection.png)

**LLM Code Audit** helps developers analyze and compare code generated by multiple AI tools to identify the best-performing and most maintainable solution.

---

##  Problem Statement

###  The Problem
- AI-generated code is often unoptimized or poorly structured.
- Manually comparing outputs is tedious and error-prone.
- Lack of tools that provide actionable feedback and ranking across LLMs.



###  Why Current Tools Fall Short
- Tools like SonarQube evaluate only post-development.
- No side-by-side LLM comparisons.
- No automatic quality metrics or recommendations.

##  Metrics Explanation

###  AI Complexity Index (ACI)
```mathematica
ACI = (0.5 × Cognitive Complexity) + (0.3 × Method Length) + (0.2 × Nesting Level)
```
### AI Maintainability Risk (AMR)
```mathematica
AMR = (0.4 × Code Smells per 100 LOC) + (0.4 × Duplication %) + (0.2 × % Uncommented Methods)
```
###  AI Readability Score (ARS)
```mathematica
ARS = (0.4 × Avg Line Length) + (0.4 × % Comments) + (0.2 × Naming Consistency)
```


##  Conclusion

**LLM Code Audit** empowers developers to take full control over AI-generated code, ensuring quality, maintainability, and clarity before integrating into production environments.
